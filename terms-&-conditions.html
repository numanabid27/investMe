                        <li class="font-600" id="info">Description of the Site and Services</li>
                        <p>The site provides users with free legal matching service (“services”) where you may be matched with third-party attorneys and related service providers (the “third party service providers”). All decisions regarding your eligibility and legal representation will be determined by the third party service providers. You understand and agree that company is not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for any legal services you may receive as a result of the services. The information that you supply on the site may include, but is not limited to: (a) your first name; (b) your last name; (c) your email address; (d) your telephone number; and (e) any other information requested in a web form contained on the site (collectively, the “site registration data”). Our use of the site registration data is governed by the privacy policy. We are not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for your use of, or inability to use and/or qualify for, services or other third party service provider’s services, or for any dispute between you and any third party service providers.</p>

                        <li class="font-600" id="use">Truthful and Accurate Information</li>
                        <p>InvestMe requires users to provide truthful and accurate information when using our app/dashboard. Ensuring the accuracy of information is crucial for the proper functioning of our services and maintaining trust with our users, that you are the subscriber for any telephone number or email address that you provide, and that you are a United States resident 18 years of age or older. If your phone number, email, or other information changes, you must notify us immediately at info@plmprivacypolicy.com. Your breach of this representation and warranty or failure to inform us immediately if your information changes subjects you to the indemnification provision for any resulting claim or allegation asserted against us or the Third Party Service Providers.</p>

                        <li class="font-600" id="security">User Guidelines</li>

                        <p>All security on our Websites is treated seriously. Where applicable, we undertake security steps, including the use of SSL technology, on our back-end systems that store customer account information and to protect data transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions cannot be accessed, altered, or deleted due to firewall or other security software failures.</p>

                        <li class="font-600" id="policy">Product Information</li>
                        <p>InvestMe does not provide legal advice or act as a referral service for legal representation. Our platform offers a free matching service connecting businesses with third-party attorneys and service providers. Information you provide may be shared with these third-party attorneys without evaluating your specific legal situation. We do not assess the quality of legal services or endorse attorneys who participate in our platform through advertising. Submitting information does not establish an attorney-client relationship, and you are not obligated to hire any attorney who contacts you through our service. The decision to retain legal counsel should not be based solely on information found on our platform.</p>

                        <li class="font-600" id="policy">Disclaimer of Warranties</li>

You understand and agree that the actions or inactions of third parties are beyond our control, and we do not guarantee that any third party will take or refrain from taking any action.</p>
                        <p>We do not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any third-party product or service advertised or offered for sale on or through the Site or any website linked to the Site.</p>

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.

Sections of these terms that naturally survive termination (such as disclaimers of warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnification) will remain in effect. These terms do not create a joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and InvestMe. Any ambiguities in these terms will not be construed against InvestMe due to drafting. InvestMe may assign its rights or obligations to others at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations without InvestMe's prior written consent.</p>
